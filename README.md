# 🔤 Autocomplete System – Data Structures Project

This project is a **second-year university assignment** for our Data Structures course. We built an **autocomplete system** that uses **graph traversal algorithms** (DFS & BFS) to enhance word prediction and search functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- **Search Engine Logic**:
  - **DFS & BFS traversal** for searching words
  - Filter by:
    - **Frequency**
    - **Lexicographical order**
    - **Word length**

- **Wildcard Pattern Matching**:
  - `*` for multiple unknown characters  
  - `_` for a single unknown character

- **Word Management**:
  - **Add** new words by typing them three times or clicking the "Add" button
  - **Delete** words by:
    - Exact word
    - Prefix match

## 🤝 Teamwork

This project was a team effort!  
**Big thanks to my amazing teammates** for their dedication, creative input, and hard work throughout this build.
